                    My name is <mark>Vikrant (Vik) Bathala</mark>, and I am a 3rd year undergraduate
                    student at the <mark>Georgia Institute of Technology</mark> pursuing my B.S. in <mark>Computational Media</mark>. Oh!
                    What is Computational Media? I'm glad you asked! Computational Media is a major that explores
                    the intersection of computer science and design/liberal arts. For example, my
                    focus is in Artificial Intelligence and Interaction Design. TL;DR half CS, half
                    design. <mark>My career interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction and AR/VR, with an emphasis
                    on educational technologies and accessible technologies</mark>.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Outside of school, I love to develop my culinary skills - I love cooking, baking, eating,
                    and anything and everything involving food. I also love singing and playing piano and
                    occasionally dabble in composing my own music. You'll also find me playing the latest
                    indie video games, traveling whenever possible, and spending some quality time with
                    the people I care about.
